# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is an early-stage project called "claude-skill-diagram-generator" that appears to be designed for generating skill diagrams related to Claude AI capabilities. The repository is currently in its initial setup phase with minimal structure.

## Current State

- **Stage**: Initial setup/planning phase
- **Files**: Only README.md and Claude Code configuration exist
- **Architecture**: Not yet defined - awaiting technology stack selection and initial implementation

## Configuration

The project includes Claude Code specific configuration in `.claude/settings.local.json` that allows:
- `Bash(tree:*)` operations for exploring directory structures

## Development Setup

Since the project is in early stages, development setup will depend on the chosen technology stack. Common next steps would likely include:

1. **Technology Selection**: Choose programming language and frameworks
2. **Project Structure**: Create appropriate directory structure for the chosen tech stack
3. **Build System**: Set up build tools, package managers, and configuration files
4. **Core Implementation**: Begin with basic diagram generation logic

## Architecture Considerations

Based on the project name, this tool will likely need to:
- Parse or understand Claude AI skill definitions
- Generate visual diagrams representing skill relationships or capabilities
- Possibly integrate with Claude AI APIs or documentation

## Future Development

When implementing this project, consider:
- What format the skill diagrams should take (SVG, PNG, interactive web components, etc.)
- How to define and parse skill data (JSON, YAML, or other structured formats)
- Whether this will be a CLI tool, web application, or library
- Integration points with existing Claude AI workflows or documentation

## Git Workflow

The repository uses `main` as the primary branch. Standard git workflows apply once development begins.
